# Papercraft-Octocat
A [Cubeecraft](http://www.cubeecraft.com/) implementation of the
GitHub [Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/original/). It's a template
for printing, cutting out and folding your own Octocat paper model.

## How to build
1. Choose your favorite file format from the repository and print it in A4 format
2. Remove all blank and text pieces around the Octocat parts (in simple words: cut it out) \[Remember also the white parts at the flaps\]
3. Cut in the red lines at the head and the torso
4. Fold the different parts (5 legs, 1 Torso, 1 head) into the right shape \[remember that one leg (number 5) has 90Â° bending\]
5. Attach the additional parts (1 pair of ears, 4 hairs) to the head
6. Attach the 5 legs (according to their enumeration) to the torso
7. Attach the torso to the head
8. Your done, have fun :)
